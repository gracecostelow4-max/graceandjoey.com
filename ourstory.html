    <p>Grace and Joeyâ€™s story began on February 13th, 2019, when a high school semester schedule change placed them both in the same 7th period photography class. Grace was a sophomore and Joey a junior. After the bell rang after class, Joey approached Grace in the hallway and introduced himself. The next day, he sat next to her. From that moment, they started talking, joking, and working on projects together. Their connection grew naturally and easily.
        One day, Joey asked Grace to go on their first date to Sparrow Bakery, a quiet coffee shop down the street from their high school during their lunch break. Over the next few months, their friendship deepened, and on August 1st, 2019, they officially became a couple.
        6 years later, on August 1st, 2025, Joey proposed in a meadow near Sparks Lake. This was a special place for both of them where Grace often took photos as a photographer and they would hang out between trips to the lake and river. The moment was filled with so much love.
        Grace and Joey share a love for nature, movie nights, and quiet afternoons on the river. While Joey fishes, Grace often relaxes on his boat, enjoying the peaceful moments together. Their relationship is built on simple joys and steady love.
